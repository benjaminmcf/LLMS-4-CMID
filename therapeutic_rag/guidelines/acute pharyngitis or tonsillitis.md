# acute pharyngitis or tonsillitis

## First line treatment

patients not at high risk of acute
rheumatic fever:
symptomatic treatment for most cases
patients at high risk of acute rheumatic
fever:
phenoxymethylpenicillin 500 mg (child:
15 mg/kg up to 500 mg) orally, 12-hourly
for 10 days
OR
benzathine benzylpenicillin
intramuscularly, as a single dose
adult: 1.2 million units (2.3 mL)
child less than 10 kg:
 0.45 million units (0.9 mL)
child 10 kg to less than 20 kg:
 0.6 million units (1.2 mL)
child 20 kg or more:
 1.2 million units (2.3 mL)



## Notes

Most cases are viral. In patients not at high risk of acute rheumatic
fever, even if infection is bacterial, antibiotic treatment is of limited
benefit.

In patients at high risk of acute rheumatic fever, antibiotic treatment
is recommended for all patients because the increased risk of acute
rheumatic fever and resultant rheumatic heart disease outweighs
the risk of harms from potentially unnecessary antibiotic treatment.

## Alternative if first line treatment is not available

patients not at high risk of acute rheumatic fever:
symptomatic treatment for most cases
patients at high risk of acute rheumatic fever:
if phenoxymethylpenicillin is not available and benzathine
benzylpenicillin is not preferred, alternative options (in order of
preference) include:
amoxicillin 1 g (child: 50 mg/kg up to 1 g) orally, daily for 10 days
OR
cefalexin 1 g (child: 25 mg/kg up to 1 g) orally, 12-hourly for 10 days
OR
cefuroxime 500 mg (child 3 months or older: 15 mg/kg up to 500 mg)
orally, 12-hourly for 10 days
