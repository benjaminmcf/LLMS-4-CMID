# acute otitis media in children

## First line treatment

symptomatic treatment for most children

## Notes

80% of cases spontaneously resolve without antibiotic treatment.
Advise the carer to return if symptoms do not improve within
72 hours. Consider a delayed prescription for antibiotic therapy.
Treat the following groups:
• infants younger than 6 months
• children younger than 2 years with bilateral infection
• children who are systemically unwell (eg lethargic, pale; fever
 alone is not sufficient)
• children with otorrhoea
• Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children
• children at high risk of complications (eg immunocompromised
 children).
Amoxicillin is first-line treatment for these groups:
amoxicillin 15 mg/kg up to 500 mg orally, 8-hourly for 5 days
